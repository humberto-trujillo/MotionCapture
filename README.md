# ARMoCap
This project is about the design and construction of a motion capture system based on inertial sensors and its integration with an augmented reality environment. The system is composed by a  network of wearable wireless sensors from which orientation data can be obtained in the form of Quaternion. Using this data type it is possible to map the movemennts of the user to an augmented reality avatar in real-time.
